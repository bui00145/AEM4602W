%% MAIN MEMO
Duirng lab, the hotwire calibration was conducted, where the voltage, measured 
using King's Law, and the airspeed was recoreded at each calibration velocity. 
With a hotwire, the airspeed can be measured from the change in voltage of the
wire, which was measured

One note with the calinration
